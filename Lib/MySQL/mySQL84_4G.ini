# MySQL Server Instance Configuration File
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generated by the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard
#
#
# Installation Instructions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On Linux you can copy this file to /etc/my.cnf to set global options,
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options
# (@localstatedir@ for this installation) or to
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# On Windows, when MySQL has been installed using MySQL Installer you
# should keep this file in the ProgramData directory of your server
# (e.g. C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y). To make sure the server
# reads the config file, use the startup option "--defaults-file". 
#
# To run the server from the command line, execute this in a 
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# To install the server as a Windows service manually, execute this in a 
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --install MySQLXY --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# And then execute this in a command line shell to start the server, e.g.
# net start MySQLXY
#
#
# Guidelines for editing this file
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that the program supports.
# If you want to know the options a program supports, start the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be
# found in the manual.
#
# For advice on how to change settings please see
# https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-configuration-defaults.html

#
# CLIENT SECTION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following options will be read by MySQL client applications.
# Note that only client applications shipped by MySQL are guaranteed
# to read this section. If you want your own MySQL client program to
# honor these values, you need to specify it as an option during the
# MySQL client library initialization.

log-bin="DELL240-bin"

# ***** Group Replication Related *****
# Specifies the server ID. For servers that are used in a replication topology,
# you must specify a unique server ID for each replication server, in the
# range from 1 to 2^32 âˆ’ 1. "Unique" means that each ID must be different
# from every other ID in use by any other source or replica.
server-id=1

# Indicates how table and database names are stored on disk and used in MySQL.
# Value 0 = Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the CREATE 
#           TABLE or CREATE DATABASE statement. Name comparisons are case-sensitive. You should not 
#           set this variable to 0 if you are running MySQL on a system that has case-insensitive file 
#           names (such as Windows or macOS). If you force this variable to 0 with 
#           --lower-case-table-names=0 on a case-insensitive file system and access MyISAM tablenames 
#           using different lettercases, index corruption may result.
# Value 1 = Table names are stored in lowercase on disk and name comparisons are not case-sensitive. 
#           MySQL converts all table names to lowercase on storage and lookup. This behavior also applies 
#           to database names and table aliases.
# Value 2 = Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the CREATE TABLE 
#           or CREATE DATABASE statement, but MySQL converts them to lowercase on lookup. Name comparisons 
#           are not case-sensitive. This works only on file systems that are not case-sensitive! InnoDB 
#           table names and view names are stored in lowercase, as for lower_case_table_names=1.
lower_case_table_names=1

# This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations, such as

max_connections=151

# The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value increases the number 
# of file descriptors that mysqld requires.
table_open_cache=4000

# Defines the maximum amount of memory that can be occupied by the TempTable 
# storage engine before it starts storing data on disk.
temptable_max_ram=2G

# Defines the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables created 
# by the MEMORY storage engine and, as of MySQL 8.0.28, the TempTable storage 
# engine. If an internal in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, it is 
# automatically converted to an on-disk internal temporary table.
tmp_table_size=512M

# The storage engine for in-memory internal temporary tables (see Section 8.4.4, "Internal 
# Temporary Table Use in MySQL"). Permitted values are TempTable (the default) and MEMORY.
internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine=TempTable

#*** MyISAM Specific options
# The maximum size of the temporary file that MySQL is permitted to use while re-creating a 
# MyISAM index (during REPAIR TABLE, ALTER TABLE, or LOAD DATA). If the file size would be 
# larger than this value, the index is created using the key cache instead, which is slower. 
# The value is given in bytes.
myisam_max_sort_file_size=2146435072

# The size of the buffer that is allocated when sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE 
# or when creating indexes with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.
myisam_sort_buffer_size=12M

# Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.
# Do not set it larger than 30% of your available memory, as some memory
# is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if you're not using
# MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 8-64M as it will also be
# used for internal temporary disk tables.
key_buffer_size=8M

# Each thread that does a sequential scan for a MyISAM table allocates a buffer 
# of this size (in bytes) for each table it scans. If you do many sequential 
# scans, you might want to increase this value, which defaults to 131072. The 
# value of this variable should be a multiple of 4KB. If it is set to a value 
# that is not a multiple of 4KB, its value is rounded down to the nearest multiple 
# of 4KB.
read_buffer_size=23K

# This variable is used for reads from MyISAM tables, and, for any storage engine, 
# for Multi-Range Read optimization.
read_rnd_buffer_size=256K

#*** INNODB Specific options ***
# innodb_data_home_dir=

# Use this option if you have a MySQL server with InnoDB support enabled
# but you do not plan to use it. This will save memory and disk space
# and speed up some things.
# skip-innodb

# If set to 1, InnoDB will flush (fsync) the transaction logs to the
# disk at each commit, which offers full ACID behavior. If you are
# willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small
# transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk I/O to the
# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and
# the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2
# means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log
# file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2

# The size in bytes of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on 
# disk. The default value changed from 8MB to 16MB with the introduction of 32KB 
# and 64KB innodb_page_size values. A large log buffer enables large transactions 
# to run without the need to write the log to disk before the transactions commit. 
# Thus, if you have transactions that update, insert, or delete many rows, making 
# the log buffer larger saves disk I/O.
innodb_log_buffer_size=16M

# The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table 
# and index data. The default value is 134217728 bytes (128MB). The maximum value 
# depends on the CPU architecture; the maximum is 4294967295 (232-1) on 32-bit systems 
# and 18446744073709551615 (264-1) on 64-bit systems. On 32-bit systems, the CPU 
# architecture and operating system may impose a lower practical maximum size than the 
# stated maximum. When the size of the buffer pool is greater than 1GB, setting 
# innodb_buffer_pool_instances to a value greater than 1 can improve the scalability on 
# a busy server.
innodb_buffer_pool_size=3G

# Defines the amount of disk space occupied by redo log files. This variable supersedes the 
# innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size variables. 
innodb_redo_log_capacity=100M

# Defines the maximum number of threads permitted inside of InnoDB. A value 
# of 0 (the default) is interpreted as infinite concurrency (no limit). This 
# variable is intended for performance tuning on high concurrency systems.
# InnoDB tries to keep the number of threads inside InnoDB less than or equal to 
# the innodb_thread_concurrency limit. Once the limit is reached, additional threads 
# are placed into a "First In, First Out" (FIFO) queue for waiting threads. Threads 
# waiting for locks are not counted in the number of concurrently executing threads.
innodb_thread_concurrency=5

# The increment size (in MB) for extending the size of an auto-extend InnoDB system tablespace file when it becomes full.
innodb_autoextend_increment=64

# The number of regions that the InnoDB buffer pool is divided into.
# For systems with buffer pools in the multi-gigabyte range, dividing the buffer pool into separate instances can improve concurrency,
# by reducing contention as different threads read and write to cached pages.
innodb_buffer_pool_instances=8

# Determines the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently.
innodb_concurrency_tickets=5000

# Specifies how long in milliseconds (ms) a block inserted into the old sublist must stay there after its first access before
# it can be moved to the new sublist.
innodb_old_blocks_time=1000

# When this variable is enabled, InnoDB updates statistics during metadata statements.
innodb_stats_on_metadata=0

# When innodb_file_per_table is enabled (the default in 5.6.6 and higher), InnoDB stores the data and indexes for each newly created table
# in a separate .ibd file, rather than in the system tablespace.
innodb_file_per_table=1

# Use the following list of values: 0 for crc32, 1 for strict_crc32, 2 for innodb, 3 for strict_innodb, 4 for none, 5 for strict_none.
innodb_checksum_algorithm=0

# If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every flush_time seconds to free up resources and
# synchronize unflushed data to disk.
# This option is best used only on systems with minimal resources.
flush_time=0

# The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use
# indexes and thus perform full table scans.
join_buffer_size=512K

# The maximum size of one packet or any generated or intermediate string, or any parameter sent by the
# mysql_stmt_send_long_data() C API function.
max_allowed_packet=64M

# If more than this many successive connection requests from a host are interrupted without a successful connection,
# the server blocks that host from performing further connections.
max_connect_errors=100

# The number of file descriptors available to mysqld from the operating system
# Try increasing the value of this option if mysqld gives the error "Too many open files".
open_files_limit=8161

# If you see many sort_merge_passes per second in SHOW GLOBAL STATUS output, you can consider increasing the
# sort_buffer_size value to speed up ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations that cannot be improved with query optimization
# or improved indexing.
sort_buffer_size=256K

# Specify the maximum size of a row-based binary log event, in bytes.
# Rows are grouped into events smaller than this size if possible. The value should be a multiple of 256.
binlog_row_event_max_size=8K


# If the value of this variable is greater than 0, a replica synchronizes its master.info file to disk.
# (using fdatasync()) after every sync_source_info events.
sync_source_info=10000

# If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL server synchronizes its relay log to disk.
# (using fdatasync()) after every sync_relay_log writes to the relay log.
sync_relay_log=10000

# Load mysql plugins at start."plugin_x ; plugin_y".
